# Unsupervised-Learning
Implementation of two unsupervised learning k-means clustering and anomaly detection

## K-means
Implementing k-means clustering by custom functions and applying the algorithm on a test image and optimizing it using the least distortion function value

## Anomaly-Detection
Implementing anomaly detection algorithm by functions and optimizing the threshold epsilon using F1 score
